    By- Shubham Khatri</h1>
    <h1>Activity 1</h1>
    <h2>We had a conversation about IoT applications in this activity, with the key questions being: What are IoT applications, what are some examples, and what are the key qualities that are required? IT applications employ hardware and software interfaces to connect with other devices through the internet, gather and analyse vast amounts of data, and then deliver the results to consumers. </h2>
    <h1>Activity 2</h1>
    <h2>We spoke about the smart building in this activity. We first explored what makes a building smart so that we could understand what smart means. Then, we spoke about several scenarios for smart buildings before identifying the essential components. Smart refers to Self-monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology, which transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, like in the case of a smart building. The Sense-Think-Act Paradigm is a set of established functions that are carried out when a given input is detected. Smart security systems, smart air conditioning, smart lighting, and smart attendance systems are a few examples of situations for smart buildings.</h2>
    <h1>Activity 3</h1>
    <h2>In the third activity, we spoke about the control interface and how all these components interact with one another. We also spoke about high level features, which are complicated features that call for a lot of hardware and software. Then we spoke about the users, who may be divided into two categories: <br>
      1. Registered Members: Corporate employees, staff, and security personnel <br>
      2. Unregistered members: Building visitors. <br>
    
  <br>
Then we dissussed about what all parts are needed which were <br> <br> Iot Sensores and Actualors <br>microcontrollers and Microprocessores <br> Graphic User interface<br> Backup Power Supply System</h2>
